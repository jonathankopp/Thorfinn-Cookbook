This repo contains cookbooks that demonstrate how to use the Thorfinn generative ai python library  


Cookbooks being curated:
- Using Throfinn to create an in-memory vecdb
- Using Throfinn to interface with a vecDB like Milvus
- Using Thorfinn to compress Token size of context for in-context learning
- Using Throfinn's search algorithms to outperform general "cosine_similarity" based searching
